# Working Feature: Multiplayer Memory Game

For this project, I decided not to use AI assistance and made all the changes myself. My goal was to get a better feel of JavaScript. I found this challange to be easier than I expected as I have already worked on a similar project before. I updated the logic to support multiple players and changed some CSS to make it obvious which player's turn it is. I also added a feature to show the winner at the end of the game in the alert and made it where players can always see what their score it.

This was fun and interesting!
