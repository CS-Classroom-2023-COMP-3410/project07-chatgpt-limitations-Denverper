## Working feature: Responsive Memory Game

I found  this challange a lot more difficult and I needed a lot of AI assitance. I found a lot of the challange was due to the CSS given being unorganized, for example, there were multiple different stylings for the same elements, confusing what was actually being applied. On top of that, the CSS was being changed in the JS file, which made it even more difficult to understand what was going on.

This seems to be an area where AI fails to help, as it can't understand the context of the code. I found that I had to manually go through the CSS and remove the unneeded styles while also adding in the new styles for the responsive design, as every time I asked for it, it failed.

While I was able to get a result, it was not as clean as I would have wanted as the CSS was still a bit of a mess. I think this is an area where AI could be improved, as it could be a lot more helpful in cleaning up the CSS and making it more organized. 

I managed to get the game to be responsive, visible on iphone, tablet, and desktop. without overlaps or issues when shrinking the screen to a reasonable point.
